## Getting Started  
CHEERS is where you can pair songs with drinks! There are four sections:
- Add Tune (add your favorite tunes and pair it with your favorite drink)
- Boozy Tunes (random pairing are shown here and you can add it to your profile)
- Profiles (view other profiles and their favorite pairings)
- My Page (view your own page details and have the ability to edit, add, delete your boozy tunes)

Users are able to:
- create, edit, and delete boozy tunes
- edit their profile
- add their favorite drink and song
- view other profiles and their boozy tunes
